This is the css for the hover effect that should be used on the nav.

```
nav a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
    background:#1A1A1A;
    padding: 10px 10px;
    transition: .4s;
    width: 100px;
  }

  nav a:hover {
    background: white;
    color: black;
    transition: .4s;
  }
```



This is the css for the cloud animation to run.

```
.cloud-mid{
    width: 150px;
    top: 50px;
    animation: wind 13s linear infinite reverse;
}

@keyframes wind {
        from {
            transform: translateX(100px)
        }
        to {
            transform: translateX(300px);
        }
}
```
